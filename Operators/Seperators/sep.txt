Seperators : 
In C language, separators (also known as delimiters) are symbols that 
are used to separate different elements of the program. 
They help in defining the structure and flow of the code. 
Here are the main separators used in C language:

1.Whitespace: 
Includes spaces, tabs, and newline characters. 
Whitespace is used to separate tokens but is otherwise ignored 
by the compiler.

2.Semicolon (;): Used to terminate statements.

3.Comma (,): Used to separate items in a list, such as function arguments and variable declarations.

4.Braces ({ and }): Used to define the beginning and end of a block of code, such as the body of a function, loop, or conditional statement.

5.Parentheses (( and )): Used to group expressions and parameters in function definitions and calls.

6.Brackets ([ and ]): Used to define array subscripts.

7.Colon (:): Used in the ternary conditional operator and labels for case in switch statements.
